11:19 < fanf2> rjk: can you do the mouseover julias in real time without the 
               reverse iteration trick now?
11:23 < fanf2> calculate the inverse of z -> z^2 + c (you get two answers each 
               time; pick one at random) and plot the course of the point. it 
               is attracted to the boundary of the julia set and wanders around 
               it
11:23 < fanf2> you can use this to draw julias very fast on 1990-era hardware


13:54 < fanf2> rjk: re julia sets: you should have a mode where the julia set 
               is displayed with the same zoom and co-ordinates as the 
               mandelbrot set, because that best demonstrates the similarity 
               between them, especially at misiurewicz points. c = i is an 
               excellent example
