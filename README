	mandy - display the Mandelbrot set and its complement
	=====================================================

		  *** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ***

This is a simple GTK+ program that lets you zoom in on the Mandelbrot
set.

Installation
============

You will need gtkmm and GNU C++.

  ./autogen.sh          # only if building from git
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

See 'man mandy' for documentation.

Fixed Point Maths
=================

For an alternative slower but higher-precision version:
  ./configure --with-fixed-point

This version is optimized for x86-64 CPUs, though should work on other
microprocessors.
