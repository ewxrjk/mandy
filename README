	mandy - display the Mandelbrot set and its complement
	=====================================================

		  *** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ***

This is a simple GTK+ program that lets you zoom in on the Mandelbrot
set.

Installation
============

  make
  sudo make install

Use
===

Display:

  When you start 'mandy' the display is divided into two halves.  The
  bottom half has the pretty pictures and the top half tells you where
  you are.

  'X centre' and 'Y centre' define the location of the centre of the
  window in the complex plane.  (X means the real part and Y the
  imaginary part.)  You start at (0,0).

  'Radius' defines gives the radius of the largest circle visible.

  'Iterations' defines the maximum number of iterations for each
  point.  Lower values are faster, higher values give more detail.

  All of the above fields can be edited directly.  Press ENTER to set
  the new values.  You will get a beep if you entered something
  invalid.

  'Pixel/s' shows how many pixels per second the program computed on
  the last run.

Mouse:

  You can use the left mouse button to drag the image around.

  You can double-click the left mouse button to zoom in on the point
  you click, and double-click the right mouse button to zoom back out.

Hacking
=======

This program requires GCC and C99 support.

All the GTK+-specific code is kept in mand.c.  The idea is to support
the possibility of other UIs.

The calculations are done in background threads in background.c.  A
worker thread is created for each CPU core that is online when the
program starts.  If cores are offlined or onlined while it runs then
the number of threads will no longer match the number of cores.
