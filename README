	mandy - display the Mandelbrot set and its complement
	=====================================================

		  *** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ***

This is a simple GTK+ program that lets you zoom in on the Mandelbrot
set.

Installation
============

You will need gtkmm and GNU C++.

  ./autogen.sh          # only if building from git
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

See 'man mandy' for documentation.

Arithmetic Type
===============

You can select the arithmetic type used to compute the images.

  ./configure                           - selects 'double'
  ./configure --with-long-double        - selects 'long double'
  ./configure --with-fixed-point        - selects fixed point arithmetic

'double' gives you about 53 bits of precision.  'long double' gives
you 64 bits of precision.  Both are floating point types and are
(probably) directly supported by your hardware, so should be fast

The fixed point type gives you 96 bits of precision (after the point,
but that's where you need it).

On x86-64 CPUs this type is implemented in hand-written assembly
language.  It is slower than the floating point version but still
usable.

On other CPUs it is implemented in C.  It is likely to be rather slow.
