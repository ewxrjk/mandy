/* How locations and sizes are treated:
 *
 * PIXEL UNITS
 * ===========
 *
 * These are (usually) integer valued and locate pixels on the screen.
 * They are also therefore the units of the mouse pointer.  (0,0) is
 * the top left.
 *
 * PLANE UNITS
 * ===========
 *
 * These identify a location in the complex plane.  It is represented
 * in the conventional way, i.e. with increasing real (X) values
 * proceeding from left to right and increasing imaginary (Y) values
 * proceeding from bottom to top.
 *
 * The objects x and y give the center of the window in plane units
 * and the object size gives the radius of the largest displayable
 * circle, i.e. the distance parallel to the real or imaginary axis
 * from the center to the nearest window edge.  The reason for this is
 * to produce sensible behavior as the window is resized.
 *
 * THE ITERBUFFER->DATA[] ARRAY
 * ============================
 *
 * This is addressed in pixel units.  Values within one row proceed from left
 * to right as addresses increase and the lowest-addressed row belongs at the
 * bottom of the screen and corresponds to the largest imaginary (Y) value in
 * plane units.  This means that you have to invert Y coordinates when
 * converting between pixel and plane units.
