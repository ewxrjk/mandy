/*
 * Some possibly-relevant rules:
 * - preserve %rbp, %rbx, %r12-%r15
 * -
 * - %rsp points at return address
 * - %rsp+8 points at arguments
 * - %rsp+8 mod 16 = 0
 * - %rsp-128 up to %rsp (red zone) is safe to use for temporaries
 * - pointer arguments count as class INTEGER
 * - INTEGER arguments are passed in %rdi %rsi %rdx %rcx %r8 %r9
 * - other classes get other registers
 * - when you run out the stack is used in reverse order
 * - INTEGER class returns are returned via %rax
 * See: http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf
 *
 * gas syntax is OP SRC,DEST (like traditional 68k syntax)
 * $ means 'immediate'
 * % means 'register'
 * OPl means 32-bit, OPq means 64-bit
